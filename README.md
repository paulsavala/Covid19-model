#### Description
Social distancing has an important effect on the spread of the coronavirus. Two possible social distancing
strategies are illustrated here: static and dynamic.
        
#### Static social distancing
Static social distancing refers to implementing social distancing over a fixed period of time. For example, 
social distancing could begin 4 weeks after the first case is reported, and last for 12 weeks.
        
#### Dynamic social distancing
Dynamic social distancing refers to "turning on and off" social distancing based on the number of cases 
reported.
        
#### The model
The model shown here is based on the paper 
["Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic"](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041079v1.article-info)
by the researchers Kissler, Tedijanto, Lipsitch and Grad at Harvard. I am in no way associated with these
researchers. For me about me, see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-savala-ph-d-61153193/)
